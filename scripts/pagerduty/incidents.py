# This script requires pygerduty: https://github.com/dropbox/pygerduty

# Given a start date and end date, this sample will export the description and
# notes from all incidents to a CSV file. The CSV file is formatted for use
# with Excel.
# This will export to incident_notes_[start date]_-_[end date].csv in the same
# directory that this script is located in.
# This would be most useful to join with a CSV file as exported from PagerDuty.

# Usage: edit subdomain and specify an API key (must have full access) below.
# (What's the subdomain? Example: http://demo.pagerduty.com --> "demo")
# Then run: python incidents.py [start date: YYYY-MM-DD] [end date: YYYY-MM-DD]
# Example: python incidents.py 2015-01-01 2015-03-31
